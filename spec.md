# CodeSubmit

## 1. Problem Statement

In most colleges, assignment submission for programming courses is **manual, repetitive, and error-prone**.

Students are expected to:

* Copy code from IDEs into Word/PDF files
* Manually run programs and paste outputs
* Add headings, metadata, dates, and formatting
* Ensure consistency across multiple files

This process:

* Wastes time
* Introduces formatting mistakes
* Breaks reproducibility (output is not verifiable)
* Punishes students for clerical errors instead of logic

There is **no standardized tool** that converts executable code into a **submission‑ready academic document**.

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

**CodeSubmit** is a command‑line driven tool that:

1. Scans a project folder
2. Collects source files (language‑agnostic)
3. Executes each file (when applicable)
4. Captures output, errors, exit codes, and runtime
5. Structures everything into a clean, academic document
6. Exports the final result as TXT / Markdown / DOCX / PDF

The output is a **single authoritative document** that contains:

* Code (formatted)
* Execution proof (output)
* Metadata (who, when, what, system info)

---

## 3. Goals

### Primary Goals

* Eliminate manual copy‑paste work
* Guarantee output authenticity via execution
* Produce submission‑ready documents
* Enforce consistent structure and formatting

### Secondary Goals

* Language‑agnostic design
* Configurable templates for different colleges
* Reproducibility and traceability

---

## 4. Target Users

* College students (CS / IT / Engineering)
* Teaching assistants
* Instructors reviewing assignments
* Anyone submitting code as documentation

---

## 5. Core Concepts

### 5.1 Execution as Source of Truth

Outputs are **not manually pasted**.
They are generated by executing the code at documentation time.

This ensures:

* Output correctness
* Verifiable behavior
* No fabricated results

### 5.2 Single Artifact Submission

Instead of multiple screenshots, terminals, and files:

→ **One document** becomes the submission artifact.

## 7. Features

### 7.1 File Discovery

* Recursive folder scanning
* Extension‑based inclusion
* Deterministic ordering

### 7.2 Code Capture

* Preserves indentation
* Language‑aware code blocks
* File‑level headers

### 7.3 Execution & Output Capture

* Supports interpreted and compiled languages
* Captures:

  * stdout
  * stderr
  * exit code
  * execution time

### 7.4 Output Modes

* Text output (default)
* Screenshot output (optional)
* Hybrid mode

### 7.5 Metadata Injection

Automatically injected metadata:

* Assignment title
* Student name
* Course / module
* Date and day
* System info (OS, Python/Java version)
* Generation timestamp

### 7.6 Export Formats

* `.txt` – raw, universal
* `.md` – structured, extensible
* `.docx` – academic friendly
* `.pdf` – final submission

---

## 8. Document Structure

### 8.1 Document Header

```
Assignment Title
Student Name
Roll Number
Course
Instructor
Date (Day, DD Month YYYY)
System Information
Generated By CodeSubmit
```

### 8.2 Per‑File Section

```
==================================================
FILE: relative/path/FileName.ext
LANGUAGE: Python / Java / etc
LINES: 120
LAST MODIFIED: YYYY‑MM‑DD HH:MM
==================================================

--- CODE ---
<code here>

--- OUTPUT ---
<execution output>

Exit Code: X
Execution Time: Ys
```

---

## 9. Configuration Design

Configuration is externalized to avoid hardcoding.

Example (`codesubmit.yaml`):

```yaml
project:
  title: Workshop 4
  course: OOP with Java
  author: Rishi Saraff
  roll_no: 23

input:
  root: ./src
  extensions: [.py, .java]

execution:
  enabled: true
  timeout: 5

output:
  format: markdown
  include_screenshots: false
```

---

## 10. CLI Interface

```bash
codesubmit generate --config codesubmit.yaml
```

Optional flags:

* `--no-exec`
* `--format pdf`
* `--output assignment.pdf`

---

## 11. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Foundation (MVP)

* Folder scanning
* Code capture
* Output execution
* Markdown export

### Phase 2 – Academic Polish

* DOCX / PDF export
* Cover page templates
* College‑friendly formatting

### Phase 3 – Advanced Proof

* Screenshot capture
* Execution logs
* Hashing for integrity

---

## 12. Constraints & Assumptions

* Runs locally
* User has required runtimes installed
* Execution is sandboxed lightly (future hardening possible)

---

## 13. Why This Matters

CodeSubmit converts **execution into evidence**.

It replaces:

* Guesswork
* Manual formatting
* Screenshot chaos

With:

* Automation
* Reproducibility
* Professional documentation

This tool solves a real academic pain point and doubles as a strong systems‑engineering portfolio project.

---

## 14. Future Extensions

* College‑specific templates
* Git integration
* Plagiarism‑safe formatting
* Online submission bundles
